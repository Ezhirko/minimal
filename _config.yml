description: I have a total of 14 years of work experience in software industry. I am working on Artificial intelligence for past 2 years, where I have worked on implementing AI based log file analysis (uses NLP), Reagent Inventory management (Time Series - LSTM), Robotic alignments using regression model. I designed and developed a Neural Network model which generates text reports for the given Chest X-Ray image or sequence of Chest X-ray images that are fed into model. This project involves usage of CNN and RNN. 
Created a probability-based model to predict downtime/peak time for a diagnostic machine using Markov chain model.
Created a clustering algorithm to group the custom CT machine protocol to identify the X ray dosage.
In the recent times I have developed a neural network model which can perform object detection using YOLO V3 architecture and Depth estimation using MIDAS architecture. It is a single encoder-decoder architecture which takes single image as input and give two images as output. i.e., one output is of Object detection and other one is depth map.
I like to keep updating myself with the developments that are happening across the industries by constant learning and knowledge sharing. I also participate in organizational Hackathons provide cutting edge solution to the problems posted. I have been consistently winning the competitions with my innovative ideas. I have acquired good understanding of the lab diagnostic health care domain and I am active in filing Intellectual property in my organization. I have my 3 ideas published.
